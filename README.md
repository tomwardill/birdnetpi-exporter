# BirdNET-Pi Prometheus Exporter

BirdNET-Pi creates numbers. Numbers mean you can make graphs of them.

## Installation

Drop this file `~/BirdNET-Pi/scripts` and run it. If you want it to persist, either run it in screen/tmux, or create a systemd unit for it.

## Usage

Configure your prometheus target for `birdnetpi.local:9091`, or use the IP directly.

You can change the port it runs on in the script.
